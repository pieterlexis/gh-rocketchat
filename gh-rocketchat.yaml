# This key specifies all the webhooks.
# Each webhook must have a unique name and unique endpoint, it must have a destination and optionally a secret to
# authenticate incoming webhooks
# e.g.
#
#    hooks:
#      - name: myHook          # Must be unique between all hooks
#        endpoint: /hook1      # Must also be unique. This is the URL endpoint where GitHub delivers the hook.
#                              # In this case it would be machine.example.com/hook1
#        secret: s3cr3t        # The shared secret for GitHub
#        destination: https://rocketchat.example.com/hooks/SOMESUPERLONGSTRING
#                              # Where to deliver the transformed webhooks
